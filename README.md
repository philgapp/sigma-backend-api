# Sigma Option Tracker App

Sigma Option Fund presents the Sigma Option Tracker. A full app meant to replace all the spreadsheets folks use to track options trades with better reporting, UI/UX, etc.

The app has two parts for now, a GraphQL NodeJS backend API and a React frontend.

This is the GraphQL API.
